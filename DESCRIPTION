Description: The idea of a color path is introduced as a level of 
 abstraction above a color palette. It is thought that a set of palettes: 
 categorical, sequential, and diverging, could be built using colors contained
 within a set of paths. A color path is built by constructing splines 
 through LUV space, then scaling the input to aim for perceptual uniformity.
 This may also be useful for constructing sets of palettes each for light mode
 and dark mode.
