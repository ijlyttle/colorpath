# colorpath

The goal of colorpath is to introduce as a level of abstraction above a color palette. It is thought that a set of palettes: categorical, sequential, and diverging, could be built using colors contained within a set of paths. A color path is built by constructing splines through HCL space, then scaling the input to aim for perceptual uniformity.

This may also be useful for constructing sets of palettes each for light modeand dark mode.

## Installation

You can install the released version of colorpath from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("colorpath")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(colorpath)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
